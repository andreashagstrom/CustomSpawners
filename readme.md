# ARK Custom Spawners

This is not a mod but its a collection of custom spawners for fanmade maps. Just drop these files in your Mod-folder and reference them as you wish.
All of these authors have given me permission to share these assets to make it easier for creature mod makers to have their creatures spawn on said custom maps. If you want your custom spawners in here, contact me.
